## $~~~~~~~~~~~$ Cross-Linguistic Communication - A Natural Language Processing Approach
**Objective** :

  The main aim of this study is to develop language translation system leveraging deep learning techniques in NLP to enable accurate translations between Hindi to English language.

**Need of this study** :
* In a globally interconnected world with diverse linguistic communities, effective communication across language barriers is essential.
* Traditional language translation methods often face challenges in capturing the contextual nuances, handling ambiguity, and providing accurate and contextually relevant translations.
* The need for a robust language translation solution is evident in various domains, including business, diplomacy, education, healthcare, and everyday communication.
* The goal is to develop a state-of-the-art language translation system that outperforms traditional methods, providing accurate, context-aware, and user-friendly translations for a diverse set of languages and applications.
* The success of this project will contribute to breaking down language barriers, fostering global communication, and promoting inclusivity in an increasingly interconnected world.

**Dataset** : 
* The dataset for this study would be The IIT Bombay English-Hindi Corpus compiled by the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay) for research purposes. This corpus consists of parallel text data in both English and Hindi languages.
* The dataset is of the size 99.7 MB
* This dataset contains pairs of sentences in English and Hindi, where each English sentence corresponds to its equivalent in Hindi. The corpus likely encompasses a diverse range of topics and genres to capture the variations in language usage across different contexts. It may include texts from various sources such as news articles, literature, websites, and possibly even user-generated content.
