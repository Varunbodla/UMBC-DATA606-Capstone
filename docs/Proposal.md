## $~~~~~~~~~~~$ Cross-Linguistic Communication - A Natural Language Processing Approach
**Objective** :

  The main aim of this study is to develop language translation system leveraging deep learning techniques in NLP to enable accurate translations between Italian to English language.

**Need of this study** :
* In a globally interconnected world with diverse linguistic communities, effective communication across language barriers is essential.
* Traditional language translation methods often face challenges in capturing the contextual nuances, handling ambiguity, and providing accurate and contextually relevant translations.
* The need for a robust language translation solution is evident in various domains, including business, diplomacy, education, healthcare, and everyday communication.
* The goal is to develop a state-of-the-art language translation system that outperforms traditional methods, providing accurate, context-aware, and user-friendly translations for a diverse set of languages and applications.
* The success of this project will contribute to breaking down language barriers, fostering global communication, and promoting inclusivity in an increasingly interconnected world.

**Dataset** : 
* The dataset for this study would be from European Parliament Proceedings Parallel Corpus 1996 – 2011 that consists of texts from the proceedings of the European Parliament.
* I am going to use Parallel corpus Italian – English dataset which is of size 188 MB.
* The dataset comprises texts extracted from the official records and proceedings of the European Parliament. These proceedings include discussions, debates, and documents
  related to legislative activities, policies, and various topics addressed by the European Parliament during the years 1996 to 2011.
  
**Approach** :
* Download the dataset from source.
* Clean the dataset using python regular expressions.
* Tokenize the data.
* Build the encoder and decoder which are neural networks.
* Train the model.
* Check the performance of the model using suitable metric.
